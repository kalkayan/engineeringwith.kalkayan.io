A place for programming titans who can code even in their sleep! — That’s the image I always had in my head about Google.

When I saw a Linkedin job alert for a Technical Program Manager (TPM) position at Google that matched my work experience, I was delighted.

But I kept no expectations in my head.

With little programming experience, working at big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon always felt like a far fetched dream. Despite insecurities about my chances of making it into Google, I decided to give it a shot.

#  The initial breakthrough: Getting an interview call.

My initial application on LinkedIn was a complete shot in the dark. Frankly, I kept no hope of hearing back.

3 days later, my phone buzzed with an email notification. It was from a Google recruiter requesting an initial phone call. I was thrilled!

The phone call was an informal chat to discuss my resume, the next steps, and an opportunity for me to know more about the role.
Key takeaways to succeed:

Getting the initial call is often the most challenging part. Google recruiters are inundated with applications, and it’s tough to stand out when applying directly online. I guess I got lucky.

The fastest way to getting an interview call in big tech companies is to get referred through someone who is already working in Google. When you identify a suitable opportunity, see if there are people in your professional/personal circle who could refer you. It will save you a lot of effort and drastically improve your chances of getting an interview call.
Interview process: A 2-month-long saga.

The interview process was rigorous as expected but still a pleasant experience. I went through 6 rounds of interviews with Googlers across multiple practices and from different countries.

For all those who think a Google interview would be a nerve-wracking experience, I can assure you its quite the opposite. All the interviewers were very friendly and made sure I was comfortable. The interview was more of a two-way conversation to get to know each other. It’s an opportunity for them to assess and equally an opportunity for you to learn more about the role and the team.
# Telephonic / Google Hangout Interview

This round was a mash-up of all the things Google was looking for in their candidate — technical know-how, project management, leadership, general cognitive skills, and dive into the professional experiences mentioned in the resume. The interviewer was from the same team I was interviewing for, and we would be working together if I was selected.

Following the interview, I heard back a positive response from my Google Recruiter in a week. I was delighted to make it through the first hurdle.
## Onsite Interviews

This is where things get serious. It’s 4 to 5 rounds of interviews held on the same day in the Google Office you are applying to join. I was looking to join the Google London office.

However, owing to the ongoing pandemic, all my onsite interviews were held via Google Hangouts. Although I could now split the 5 interviews into 2 days to give myself breathing space, it also meant that Googlers from across the globe will now interview me.

My interviewers were from London, Dublin, Washington, and New York City offices. It gave me an insight into the global scale of Google operations and an opportunity to meet Googlers with diverse skillsets based in different regions.

The 5 onsite rounds were as follow:

- 2 rounds of Technical Interviews
- 2 rounds of Program Management Interviews
- 1 round of Cross-Functional Interview — Interview with a Googler who is from a different technical background. E.g., If you are interviewing for Data Centre Operations, he might be a software engineer.

Unlike most companies where the interview experience can vary widely based on the interviewer and their mood on the day, Google has taken a lot of time and effort to streamline the process to avoid such scenarios. From what I understand, all interviewers are provided with a system-generated list of questions to ask based on the role instead of them having to come up with questions on the fly between their busy schedules.
