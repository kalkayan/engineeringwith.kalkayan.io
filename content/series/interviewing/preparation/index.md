<!-- `Assess` (Understanding) --> `Strategize` (approaching) --> `Practice` (Improving)  -->


When I was preparing there were a ton of article and vidoes out there which basically wasted my time, so the most . I'm gonna directly jump into the important stuff and try not to sugarcoat anything.

# Assess

`#Tip` --> Ask yourself the following questions -- How familiar are you with algorithms? How much practice have you done? And most importantly, How well you can explain your thought process.

        Apply online on bloomberg's <a href="https://careers.bloomberg.com/">career</a> website.

        If they like your application, You will receive an email asking to schedule your phone interview

        If the initial interviewer gave you a positive feedback then you will be proceeded for the onsite interviews.

###### How familiar are you with algorithms?

I had a working understanding of most classical algorithms and their paradigms but never applied them in questions. Graphs and Dynamic Programming were among the weakest, and I had difficulty implementing the solutions. 

###### How much practice have you done?

A little about me, I had received a pre-placement offer from Adobe at the start of my senior year (Aug 2020). So,  I was not looking to interview at places.

###### How well you can explain your thought process?

I didn't consider this until it cost me an interview (The biggest mistake in the Bloomberg interview). This matter turned out to be the most important thing; The solution is no good if you can't explain it.

# Strategize your preparation

`#Tip` --> Now, you know where you are and where you are heading. Instead of blindly jumping directly into solving questions, you may want to lay the course for your journey, i.e., `strategize your preparation`. 

Account for the time you have and divide your clearly defined goals among them. Please don't get overwhelmed with the word strategy here. Just write the topics you want to cover over a piece of paper and cross off the items you complete. (I used sticky notes for this purpose).

Topics on my list were sorting, Searching, divide-and-conquer, Hash Table, graph representation, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, recursive algorithms, data structure specific algorithms, Trees, Stacks, Queues.
