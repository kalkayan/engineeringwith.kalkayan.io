# Beware: Things go wrong

There are a few things I learned by getting reading tons of interview experiences on Leetcode and personally getting rejected at Interview.   

{{< layouts/row >}}

    {{< layouts/col "px-1" >}} 
        <h3>Always code optimally!!</h3>
        <div class="mb-2">
            Don't waste their time and especially your time on brute force solutions (Just brief them about it - 30 secs)
        </div>
    {{< /layouts/col >}}

    {{< layouts/col "px-1" >}} 
        <h3>Take fewer hints</h3>
        <div class="mb-2">
            Take zero if possible and only when if absolutely necessary (dead end situation)
        </div>
    {{< /layouts/col >}}

{{< /layouts/row >}}

### Own your thoughts

If you have a solution in mind, you should be able to sing it like a song. Explain you thinking process (this is what they are interested in). 

Take a moment, build the explanation in your head and tell them step by step - data structures involved, algorithm paradigm, time complexity and space complexity etc.

---

### Write neat and tidy code

- Always think you have to get it merged in the production and people are ready to reject your PR.
- Proper variable & function naming - absolutely avoid  `s`, `a`, `A` or functions like `solve`, `go`) 
- Use the code space properly - cleaner `if`, `for`, `while` and `function` blocks.
