Interviewing is the ultimate end game at least for most of the software engineers. The idea of this series is to share my expereince and some things that i learnt. 

*If you want this too much. You're going to fuck it up.*


<!-- Motivation The course of this series is pretty simple. In the first article, I talk about my preparation strategy and some things that I learned along the way, which contributed to the offers I received â€” followed by a deep dive into my interviewing experiences and the resources I used. Finally, ending the series with the conclusion and some more tips.  -->
