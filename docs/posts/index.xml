      <description>In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll create a script (lets call it as setup) in $HOME directory to automate all the installations and other setup. Lets make a list of bins (available on brew) and casks that we want to install. In the setup file add two array - bins and casks.
#!/bin/bash  # Brew casks and binaries that you need bins = ( &amp;#34;nvm&amp;#34; &amp;#34;php@7.4&amp;#34; &amp;#34;composer&amp;#34; # more valid brew formula here ) casks=( &amp;#34;slack&amp;#34; &amp;#34;postman&amp;#34; # add brew casks that you need  ) Compilers and Interpreters The first thing in the setup for any type of software development should be getting the language support - installating the compiler, interpreters etc.</description>

      <description>Customizing an operating system has always fascinated programmers. There are tons of great articles out there with great customization tips. Most of these articles use dotfiles for customization, and these simple invisible files may seem pointless for a novice. But, they become a swiss army knife if properly configured.
Personalizing a system takes a lot of time and hard work, and nobody wishes to do it over and over again. Setting up a machine with a preferred setting should be done in minimal steps and without writing any code.</description>
